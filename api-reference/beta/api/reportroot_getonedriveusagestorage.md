Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- Site Type
- Storage Used (Byte)
- Report Date
- Report Period

### JSON

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a **[siteUsageStorage](../resources/siteusagestorage.md)** object in the response body.
